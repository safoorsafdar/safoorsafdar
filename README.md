## 👋 Hi, I&apos;m Safoor 

My name is Safoor Safdar 👨‍💻 and I&apos;m a cloud solution architect and consultant DevOps.


🔥🔥 Cloud Solution Architect / Consultant DevOps

- Working experience on `AWS`, `Azure` and `on-premises`, architect highly available, scalable, and fault-tolerant architectural solutions for clients to help them migrate successfully from current infrastructure (on-premise) to AWS cloud or set up from scratch on AWS.
- Highly motivated and committed Consultant DevOps experienced in Automating, Configuring, and deploying instances on AWS and on-premises.
- Strong knowledge and skills in AWS Architecture Design, especially in Production, Development, and Testing environments.
- Solid experience in all the phases of the Software development life cycle starting from requirement gathering, analysis, design, coding, implementation, and support.
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, Ubuntu, RHEL, Centos and AWZ2, AWS, Azure and GCP cloud services, TeamCity, Gitlab, and DeployBot, Kubernetes using Kubeadm and Kubespray, Docker, Helm, Shell Script, Prometheus, Grafana, containerization.
- Proficient experience in Infrastructure as code using Terraform, Ansible, CDK, and Cloud Operation/Toils automation using Python and NodeJS for AWS, on-premises.
