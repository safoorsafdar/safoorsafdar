A site reliability engineer in the DevOps world with a passion for architecting cloud solutions.

- Strong knowledge and skills in AWS Architecture Design, especially in Production, Development, and Testing environments.
- Solid experience in all the phases of the Software development life cycle starting from requirement gathering, analysis, design, coding, implementation, and support.
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, Ubuntu, RHEL, Centos and AWZ2, AWS, Azure and GCP cloud services, TeamCity, Gitlab, and DeployBot, Kubernetes using Kubeadm and Kubespray, Docker, Helm, Shell Script, Prometheus, Grafana, containerization.
